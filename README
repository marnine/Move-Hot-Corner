Notice to Packagers
-------------------

Please contact me before packaging this extension.


Version:
--------

V1.0   7/9/2011    GNOME Shell 3.0

V2.0   11/9/2011   GNOME Shell 3.2 


Installation:
-------------

Copy the tarball to $HOME/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
and unpack it.  A directory called movehotcorner@fpmurphy.com
should be created. It can also be installed globally at 
/usr/share/gnome-shell/extensions.

Restart your GNOME shell (Alt-F2 r is one way) and enable the 
extension using: 

     gnome-shell-extension-tool -e movehotcorner@fpmurphy.com

To disable the extension:

     gnome-shell-extension-tool -d movehotcorner@fpmurphy.com

Other tools such as gnome-tweak-tool, gsettings and dconf-editor
can also be used to enable or disable the extension. 

If the extension does not install, check the version number in
metadate.json.  You may have to change it to work with your
particular version of the GNOME Shell. If this does not fix 
the problem, use Looking Glass (Alt-F2 lg) to see what the
error message is.


Options
-------

There are a number of options that you can configure. See
the top of extension.js for details.  Also stylesheet.css.


Notes:
------

This is experimental software. 

All other extensions should be removed before using this 
extension for the first time.  Once you have confirmed that
this extension works in your particular environment, you can 
re-install or re-enable your other extensions.

This has only been tested on Fedora 16 without any other
installed extensions.  The activitiesbuttoni@fpmurphy.com
extension is known to interfer with displaying the ripples. 

This only works with one monitor. No attempt had been made to 
handle multiple monitors.
